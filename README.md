## Project Overview

This project is part of the Major Special Project for Scientific and Technological Innovation 2025 in a certain city, aiming to develop an integrated technology for investment and financing based on enterprise credit and intellectual property evaluation, and promote its practical application.

## Project Background and Necessity

### Background

With the in-depth implementation of scientific and technological innovation plans and the continuous upgrading of industrial structures, the demand for financial services from small and medium-sized enterprises, especially technology-based small and medium-sized enterprises, is increasing. Meanwhile, the rapid development of financial technology applications has provided possibilities for innovating financial service models.

### Necessity

1. **Needs of Scientific and Technological Innovation Planning and Industrial Structure Upgrading**: This project helps improve the financing efficiency of technology-based small and medium-sized enterprises and promotes the upgrading of industrial structures.
2. **Endogenous Demand for Financial Services of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises**: It meets the demand for financial services from small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly technology-based ones, and promotes their healthy development.
3. **Overall Development Trend of Financial Technology Applications**: It complies with the development trend of financial technology applications and drives financial innovation.

## Research Status and Development Trends

### Research Status

1. **Development of Intellectual Property Financing Services**: Currently, there are some intellectual property financing services available, but those targeting technology-based small and medium-sized enterprises are still inadequate.
2. **Enterprise Credit Evaluation**: Traditional credit evaluation methods mostly rely on subjective scoring and financial performance, lacking sufficient evaluation of intangible assets.

### Development Trends

1. **Intellectual Property Financing Services for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises**: More emphasis will be placed on the value assessment of intellectual property and financing innovation.
2. **Credit Evaluation of High-tech Small and Medium-sized Enterprises**: More non-financial indicators will be introduced to improve evaluation accuracy.
